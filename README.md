# SALIBANK-1.0
SALIBANK APPLICATION -> SALIBANK 1.0.py
ARDUINO -> Dummy_signaling.ino

the program only works with the correct setup (prototype), modifications are needed if open from other places.

Remmber to install the python packages if you dont have it, look at the beginning of the "SALIBANK 1.0.py".

Remmber to change the respective ports address for the component if you connect them.

Create the backup and copy database and add the path to the code.
